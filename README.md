# Plane Crashes Analysis

This project explores historical plane crashes from 1908 to 2019. The goal is to analyze trends in aviation safety, fatalities, and survival rates across different aircraft, operators, and countries.

> **Inspiration:** I was inspired by the recent plane crash of the Turkish Air Force in Georgia. This tragic event sparked my interest in aviation safety and historical accident patterns, motivating me to dive deeper into this dataset.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Plane Crashes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cgurkan/airplane-crash-data-since-1908)  
- File: `plane_crashes_cleaned.csv` (cleaned and preprocessed for analysis)

## Key Analyses
- Crash counts per year and decade
- Total and average fatalities, including ground fatalities
- Survival and fatality rates
- Military vs civilian flights
- Crashes by country and aircraft type
- Insights from accident summaries

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python:** pandas, numpy  
- **Visualization:** matplotlib 
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

## Insights
- **Safety Trends:** Accidents have decreased significantly since 2000. Modern aviation is safer than ever.  
- **Crash Lethality:** Despite fewer accidents, crashes remain highly deadly, with average fatality ratios above 80%.  
- **Historical & Exceptional Events:** Older aircraft and rare catastrophic events, such as 9/11, greatly influence total fatalities.  
- **Geography:** The United States records the most crashes, reflecting its high flight volume and detailed reporting.
